#The-Blackjack-Capstone-Project
#The deck is unlimited in size. 
#There are no jokers. 
#The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
#The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
#Use the following list as the deck of cards:
#cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
#The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
#Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
#The computer is the dealer.
#If the computer and user scores are both over 21, the user loses. 
#If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. 
#If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses (even if the user also has a blackjack)
#If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins (unless the computer also has a blackjack).
#If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. 
#If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. 
#If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.
#Game ends immediately when user score goes over 21 or if the user or computer gets a blackjack.
#The computer should keep drawing cards unless their score goes over 16.
